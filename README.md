# neetcode in python
I do want write these in Rust as well

Hopefully this will help me in landing a job? idk coding interviews are hard

## Categories
The categories follow the ones in neetcode, which I think is mapped out pretty well.
There are some questions that I think belong to different categories (ex: car fleet) but this will do for now

TODO: Add general guide on methods of tackling hard problems
TODO: Tips on recognizing what DS/A to use (I mean I wanna know myself)
